# Hello world!

## What is this blog?

Let's start with a confession. We spend too much of our conscious time on consuming content (like reading articles, watching videos). This blog is my effort to produce content worth sharing with intermediate to expert audience, but with enough information to get you started if you are a beginner.

## Audience
I will deep dive into protocols, platforms, frameworks and all the things that make computers, and the modern world, function. If you are into these things, go ahead and explore.
